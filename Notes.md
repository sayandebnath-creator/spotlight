## Create and Post on Feed is important to understand

## Used Convex(DATABASE) and Clerk(LOGIN)

Switched to binary upload using FileSystem.uploadAsync
Removed FormData completely
In Expo SDK 54, used expo-file-system/legacy to avoid deprecation errors

## In real-world application:
Scroll view wants to render all post which will crash due to lack of memory (so we use flatlist as it renders only when it's needed on the current available screen and saves memory and improve performance)

# 🎉 ScrollView vs FlatList
## Use FlatList when:
Performance is critical: FlatList only renders items currently visible on screen, saving memory and improving performance.
Long lists of data: When rendering potentially large sets of data (feeds, search results, message lists).
Unknown content length: When you don't know in advance how many items you'll need to display.
Same kind of content: When displaying many items with the same structure.
## Use ScrollView when:
All content fits in memory: When you're displaying a small, fixed amount of content that won't cause performance issues.
Static content: For screens with predetermined, limited content like forms, profile pages, or detail views.
Mixed content types: When you need to display different UI components in a specific layout that doesn't follow a list pattern.
Horizontal carousel-like elements: Small horizontal scrolling components like image carousels with limited items.

# 🚀 Pressable vs TouchableOpacity
## Use Pressable when:
More customization is needed: Pressable offers more customization options for different states (pressed, hovered, focused).
Complex interaction states: When you need to handle multiple interaction states with fine-grained control.
Future-proofing: Pressable is newer and designed to eventually replace the Touchable components.
Platform-specific behavior: When you want to customize behavior across different platforms.
Nested press handlers: When you need to handle nested interactive elements.
## Use TouchableOpacity when:
Simple fade effect: When you just need a simple opacity change on press.
Backwards compatibility: When working with older codebases that already use TouchableOpacity.
Simpler API: When you prefer a more straightforward API with fewer options to configure.
Specific opacity animations: When you need precise control over the opacity value on press.
Legacy support: For maintaining consistency with existing components.

# 📸 Expo Image vs React Native Image
## Use Expo Image when:
Performance: Expo Image uses native image libraries that can offer better performance.
Caching: Built-in caching system is more robust and configurable.
Modern image capabilities: Need for advanced features like content-aware resizing, blurhash placeholders, and progressive loading.
Transitions: When you need smooth transitions between image loading states.
Cross-platform consistency: More consistent behavior across iOS and Android.
Adaptivity: Better support for adaptive images based on screen size and resolution.
## Use React Native Image when:
Simplicity: When you need basic image display with minimal configuration.
Bundle size: When you're trying to keep your app's bundle size smaller.
No Expo dependency: When you're not using Expo or want to minimize dependencies.
Legacy support: When maintaining compatibility with existing code that uses React Native Image.
Basic requirements: When advanced image features aren't needed for your use case.

## Expo go splashscreen does not show the image as it needs preview build to show (png file with transparent bg)
